Real-Time Monitoring:

1. Use built-in tools from orchestration frameworks like Apache Airflow, Kubernetes, or AWS Step Functions to monitor task execution status.
2. Visualize pipeline metrics such as task duration, data volume processed, and success/failure rates on a dashboard using tools like AWS CloudWatch.



Error Notifications:

1. Integrate with email (e.g., SMTP), chat platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams), or incident management tools (e.g., PagerDuty) for real-time notifications.
2. Set up alerts for specific conditions like task failure, delayed execution, or missing data.



Health Checks:

1. Automate periodic health checks for data sources, pipeline configurations, and dependent systems (e.g., databases, APIs).
2. Use monitoring probes to validate the readiness and liveness of services.



Data Quality Monitoring:

1. Implement tools like Great Expectations or custom Python scripts to check for anomalies in data.
2. Set up thresholds for acceptable ranges of metrics like null values, duplicates, or schema drift.



Audit Trails:

1. Maintain detailed logs and metadata for every ETL task, including execution time, rows processed, and task status.
2. Store logs centrally (e.g., in AWS CloudWatch, Elasticsearch, or an S3 bucket) for long-term analysis and debugging.



Alerting Thresholds:

1. Define thresholds for various pipeline metrics (e.g., processing time, memory usage, success rate).
2. Configure alerts to trigger when thresholds are breached. For example:
  -->High memory or CPU usage on a node.
  -->Pipeline taking longer than usual to process data.
  -->Sudden spike/drop in data volume.



Retry and Fallback Alerts:

1. Configure alerts for when retries are triggered or when a fallback process (e.g., using backup data sources) is initiated.











Example Setup with Apache Airflow

Error Logging:
Use Airflow’s built-in task logs for granular details.
Store logs in persistent storage (e.g., S3) for long-term access.

Alerts:
Use EmailOperator or custom alerting hooks to send success/failure emails.
Integrate with Slack via the SlackAPIPostOperator.

Monitoring:
Enable Airflow Monitoring Dashboard.
Track DAG run durations and task statuses on Airflow’s web UI.

Example Custom alert function -

# Default arguments for Airflow tasks
default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'email_on_failure': True,
    'email_on_retry': True,
    'retries': 3,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
    'on_failure_callback': failure_alert_function,  
}

# Failure alert function
def failure_alert_function(context):
    task_instance = context['task_instance']
    subject = f"ETL Task Failed: {task_instance.task_id}"
    message = f"""
    Task {task_instance.task_id} failed in DAG {task_instance.dag_id}.
    Execution date: {context['execution_date']}
    Log URL: {context['task_instance'].log_url}
    """
    send_email(to='alert@example.com', subject=subject, message=message)
