Understand the API Changes:

- Review the new API documentation to identify the structural changes (e.g., new endpoints, field modifications, authentication updates, etc.).
- Determine how these changes impact the data schema, API requests, and downstream processes.


Impact Analysis:

- Analyze which parts of the ETL pipeline are affected (e.g., data extraction, transformations, unified schema).
- Assess the potential disruptions to dependent systems and data consumers.


Update the ETL Code:

- Modify the API interaction logic to align with the new structure (e.g., update HTTP request payloads, headers, or endpoints).
- Update data parsing, mapping, and validation logic to handle the updated data schema.


Schema Adjustments:

- If the API introduces new fields or changes existing ones, update the schema used in your pipeline (raw data storage, transformation logic, and final database schema).
- Ensure backward compatibility, if required, for historical data.


Testing:

- Test the updated API integration to ensure successful data extraction without errors.
- Perform end-to-end testing of the pipeline to validate the entire flow (from extraction to loading).
- Simulate edge cases and failure scenarios to ensure robustness.


Version Control and Rollback Plan:

- Use version control to track changes in the ETL code.
- Prepare a rollback plan in case the new API integration causes unforeseen issues.


Communication and Documentation:

- Inform relevant stakeholders (e.g., data consumers, team members) about the changes and any potential impacts.
- Update pipeline documentation to reflect the new API structure and the corresponding pipeline changes.


Deployment and Monitoring:

- Deploy the updated pipeline to production in a controlled manner (e.g., staggered or in non-peak hours).
- Closely monitor the pipeline post-deployment to identify and resolve any issues quickly.


Iterative Improvements:

- Gather feedback from the team and data consumers to ensure the pipeline continues to meet requirements.
- Optimize the pipeline if the new API structure offers better efficiency or data granularity.
