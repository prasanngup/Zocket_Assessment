Importance of Documentation in ETL Pipeline Development - 

Documentation is a critical component of ETL pipeline development, as it ensures that the pipeline is understandable, maintainable, and scalable by other team members and future maintainers. 
Without proper documentation, pipelines can become "black boxes," leading to inefficiencies, errors, and difficulties in debugging or extending the workflow. Good documentation facilitates 
collaboration, onboarding, and long-term maintainability while ensuring alignment with organizational goals.
